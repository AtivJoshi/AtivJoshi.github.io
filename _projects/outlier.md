title: Outlier Detection on FPGA
description: >
    The project involves designing, implementation and analysis of anomaly detection algorithms. The desired goal is to build a hardware for an online (real-time) algorithm designed to detect anomalies when the input is real-time data. A regression model is maintained in online fashion and Cook's Distance is used as a metric to find outlier. Results are compared with a Mahalanobis Distance based similar approach. The Cook's Distance gives accurate results even when the fraction of outliers is large. The final code was dumped on an FPGA.
