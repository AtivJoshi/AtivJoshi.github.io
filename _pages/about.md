I am a PhD student in the [Manning CICS](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst), where I am advised by [Dr. Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/) at the [SOLAR Lab](https://solar.cs.umass.edu/).

Broadly, I am interested in optimization, information theory, and learning theory. Currently, I work on making [online algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm) for network caching and formally prove their performance guarantees. During my graduate studies, I have also worked on [computer algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra), [probabilistic graphical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model) and [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity). 

Prior to this, I was a Research Assistant at the [Learning and Networks Group](https://www.tifr.res.in/~abhishek.sinha/group.html), TIFR led by [Dr. Abhishek Sinha](https://www.tifr.res.in/~abhishek.sinha/). I obtained my masters' in Computer Science from [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in//) (CMI) and my BTech in Information and Communication Technology from [Ahmedabad University](https://ahduni.edu.in/academics/schools-centres/school-of-engineering-and-applied-science/).

<!-- As an undergrad, I was a research intern at IIT-Gandhinagar in 2017 and a summer student at Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai in 2018. I completed my BTech project at CMI where I was advised by Dr. [Partha Mukhopadhyay](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~partham/), and my masterâ€™s thesis with Dr. [Navin Kashyap](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~nkashyap/) at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your adDr.ess / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
